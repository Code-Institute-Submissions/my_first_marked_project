    <h3> Hi there, We are the Script and Welcome to our website! We are a dynamic trio that creates pop rock music.</h3>
    <p> We have worked tirelessly for the last 50 years to create a name for ourselves across the world. In 2008 we released our first official single, "We Cry" which hit 8th in the UK and Irish charts. We then followed up with our second official single,
      "The Man Who Cant Be Moved" which peaked at 2nd on the UK and Irish charts. Then on the 11th of August 2008 the Band and I released our first album, "The Script" which reached 1st in the UK charts for three consecutive weeks! Since then we have
      continued to make music. All of this wouldn't have been possible without the help and support of our fans, so thank you! </p>

    <h1> Meet the team:</h1>
    <h3> Danny O'Donoghue</h3>
    <p> Hi im Danny, and im the lead singer in our group. I was born on October 3rd 1980 in Ballinteer, Dublin, Ireland. My father was always a big influence on me growing up, i guess you could say i got my musical talent from him! I am one of 6 siblings,
      unfortunately being the youngest. I am currently a member of 'The Voice' judge panel, along with three other amazingly talented musicians! </p>
    <h3> Glen Power</h3>
    <p> HI im Glen, and im the drummer in our group. I was born on the 5th July 1978 in Ballinteer, Dublin, Ireland. I started playing drums when i was eight years old and played throughout Ireland before meeting my bandmates in 2001. Similar to Danny, it
      was my mother who persuaded me to take up drums when i was a child, and the rest, as they say, is history!</p>
    <h3> Mark Sheehan</h3>
    <p> Hi im Mark, and im the lead guitarist in our group, as well as backing vocals. I was born on October 29th 1976 in Ballinteer, Dublin, Ireland. I signed my first recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment in 1998 and later found all my band mates
      in 2001, when The Script was created!</p>
    <h3> Rodney Alejandro</h3>
    <p> Hi im Rodney, and im the composer and producer for The Script. I grew up in Houston Texas and was born on January 24 1969. I have achieved a lot in my career, including creating the sound track for Stuart Little, but my biggest achievement was and
      always will be, creating music with the guys, so thank you for your support!</p>
