STRATEGY:
i am aiming to achieve an informative website that showcases the strong musical talents of the band, 
also showcasing that they have a strong stage presence, and that they are available for hire...
my target audience is to attract a new fan base, as well as maintain their current fan base.

SCOPE:
features such as...
-bookings page
-ability to listen to bands music, both on video and in audio
-photo album page/tweets
-contact links/social media links
-dropdown navigation menu when in mobile view
-full navigation bar whilst on desktop view

STRUCTURE:
the structure of the website should be easily navigated; as the band has been playing for over 50
years, they will have fans of all ages. The information should be easily displayed, and navigation
buttons should be clear and easily found.

SCOPE:
The information should be implemented in blocks; they will navigate the information with clear 
buttons displayed on every page, as well as navigation bar. Each category will have a linked 
relationship, so that the entire website is easily navigated and the flow of the website is 
strong. The highest priority is to have the bands material on the website for people to observe
and listen to, and the lowerst priority is the social media links, as they are still in the 
process of setting up the platforms. We will navigate through those priorities by a navbar.

SURFACE: 
bright colours to make the viewer happy (astectically pleasing). Simple transitions such as
hover will be used.
