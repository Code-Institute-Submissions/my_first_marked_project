# MY_FIRST_MARKED_PROJECT https://jakematthews1234.github.io/my_first_marked_project/html

- In this project i focused on developing my front end skills with the use of HTML and CSS.
I have pushed my knowledge to its limit and boundaries by creating content with both code
types i never thought i would. I was given the task to create a web page that showcased
a band's ("The Script") ability. I have learnt many skills throughout this project, 
including troubleshooting whenever a problem appeared. This was a great skill to learn 
because all front-end developers face issues on a daily basis with code and so troubleshooting allows
people to overcome problems they face whilst developing content.


- I faced many challenges throughout my time of completing this project, including making 
the webpages responsive. This was a major challenge because a lot of the content i had
on my web pages clashed with each other, overlapping and had many break-points to which
i used media queries and bootstrap in order to overcome. Overall this project has been
incredibly beneficial toward my development as a software developer as this was my first
real experience in being a front-end coder. It has shown me what daily problems i would
face, if i were to be in a professional environment.


# UX

- I am aiming to achieve an informative website that showcases the strong musical talents
of the band, also showcasing that they have a strong stage presence, and that they are 
available for hire. My target audience is to attract a new user base, as well as maintain
their current fan base.

- The users would want to see examples of the bands music, both videos and audio, and so both
were added, which allows the user to see a sample of what the band can do before they consider
hiring them on the bookings page for events such as birthdays or weddings. I added a navigation
bar for convenience for the user as it would make finding information much easier for the user.

# user story:
- A user wished to book in the band for an event, and i added a bookings page with a sign up form 
for them to complete so that they were able to enquire about the specific dates they wish to hire
the band.


# FEATURES

- I decided to implement was a sign up button. This gave the user the ability to
have a personalised account on the webpage so that they could keep up to date with the 
band on a more frequent and personal level. This also allowed users to apply for a date 
for booking the band in for an event.

- Another feature i decided to add was a music page. This gave the user the ability to 
  view a variety of pieces of music that the band has created, allowing them to make 
  an informed decision on whether the user enjoys the band's music. 

- Another feature i decided to implement was a navigation bar. This allowed users
  to navigate the band's page with ease, so that they could find their way to 
  specific information quickly and efficiently, without creating inconvenience
  to the user.

- Another feature idea that i could possibly implement would be a calender for
  the Bookings page. This would be useful to the user because it would allow the
  user to see exactly what days the band was free, and what days are bookable.

# TESTING

- In the testing of my web page; i asked as many people i could find in order
  to create an accurate representation of what my web pages should look like, 
  as well as what features should be implemented. This was especially useful 
  as it allowed me to step out of my own mind and look at my project from 
  a users point of view.
